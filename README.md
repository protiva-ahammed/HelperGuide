#####Helps us to find helpers nearby

**1.1	About Helper-Guide:**
Helper-Guide is a well-fair website. It can help millions of underprivileged and unorganized work-force in finding local employment, free of cost, directly from the nearby employers, and without the middlemen in between. It also provides a courier service which helps its branch members to search any product, order, customer quickly. 
This project’s idea had come by experience from own student life living in hostel, knowing experience, problems from daily-workers around me, friends, juniors, acquainted people.

**1.2	Necessity of Helper-Guide:**
In our country there is no fixed or trusted organization where people can find electrician, mechanics, plumber, cleaner, chore helper, mason, carpenter, wall-painters. It takes a lot of time to find them. Living in Rajshahi many problems have to be faced by students, general people if they have electronic devices which stop working, anyone to help in accommodation related works, problems. They totally have to depend on hostel – owner, house-owner, hall-supervisor to resolve these problems. Despite of facing day to day life problems owners sometimes are not kind enough to find them. In-fact hostel-owners take extra money from students and also from the helpers. Followings are some important necessity of Helper-Guide.
•	General people, students can find authenticate helpers without solely depends on other people.
•	General people, students can communicate with helpers without others as via.
•	Helper /daily-workers such as electrician, mechanics, plumber, cleaner, chore helper, mason, carpenter, wall- painters can find their jobs without middlemen.
•	Daily-workers/helpers do not have to share their earnings with middlemen.
•	Daily-workers/helpers can find job though they don’t belong to any branded organization.
•	General people have to pay extra money if they take services from branded company’s wall-painters, carpenters etc.
•	Any people, students who can solve daily life’s problem solved by daily-workers can create there profile and people can hire them. It will be a extra earning source for many students, people .They also can be skilled by real-life experiences.


**1.3 Problems in real life:**
In real life as an organization to provide authenticate helpers is a big deal. Another problem is many helpers are not well skilled with digital devices, they also don’t have access to internet or smart device. Many daily-workers/helpers do not have jobs to do but some others get a lot of jobs which they do not even provide service within time. Sometimes general people need a group of helpers for several months as example building house, furniture. Then they have to face a lot of problem to collect group of helpers. In Helper-Guide following problems had been faced:
•	Finding details of different daily-workers/helpers
•	Post jobs so all daily-workers/helpers can apply
•	How can daily-workers/helpers apply for job post
•	How to identify authenticate daily-workers/helpers
•	Creating daily-workers/helpers own profile and updates
•	How client, student can find daily-workers/helpers who have well performance
•	If anyone don’t have receipt copy or forget serial no how can they find their things
•	How branch member can find orders quickly
•	How branch member of courier service don’t have to manually fill up receipts.


**1.4	Observation:** In real life implementation company like WorkUp, Inc.
Freelencer.com were observed where developers, bloggers, writers etc. can find jobs.
In Workup.com jobs were posted and people apply in those and they give it to applicants by watching their profile and requirement match. In Freelancer they post a job and people beat it to get the job where company don’t directly chose viewing applicant details.

**1.5	 Solutions and Application of Helper-Guide:**
From observation to implement and solve problems in Rajshahi it was deceided that in website daily-workers/helpers can create their own profile, clients can post their jobs. Helpers can directly contract clients or apply for job. Client also can choose helpers viewing their details, rating. So, the limitations of observed websites has been solved in Helper-Guide.
